* fswitch-mode
fswitch-mode is a GNU Emacs minor mode for switching quickly between
buffers with the <f> keys.
* Setup
- Clone the repository.
- Add it to your emacs init:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/fswitch-mode")
(require 'fswitch-mode)
(fswitch-mode)
#+END_SRC
* Usage
Using fswitch-mode is easy. When fswitch-mode starts, none of the
<f>-keys are associated with a buffer. When you press an <f>-key that
is not associated with a buffer fswitch-mode automatically binds that
buffer to that <f>-key. When you press an <f>-key that is bound to a
buffer you automatically switch to that buffer. Unbinding an <f>-key
can be done by prefixing it: eg. C-u <f1>. fswitch-mode also provides
an interactive function called fswitch-clear which unbinds all
<f>-keys at once. When you press an <f>-key that has a buffer
associated with it that has since died, that <f>-key gets
automatically unbound as well.
